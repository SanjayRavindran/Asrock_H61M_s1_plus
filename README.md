EFI for my Hackintosh Machine
If you have the Exact same Hardware configuration as like me you can use this EFI for verification purpose.Please note that even though you have the same/different Ivy Bridge processor, you should have the same Mother Board to use my EFI.If you are successful please consider donating via PayPal...That would be helpful for to keep creating!!

**DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU HAVE DIFFERENT MACHINE AND MADE SOME MESS ON YOUR MACHINE **

## Configuration is as follows ##

 - ***i3-3220 with Intel HD 2500 iGPU*** (use iMac13,1 SMBIOS If you use i3 processors, Intel HD 2500 - Hardware acceleration doesnot work. Change below SMBIOS if   you upgrade beyond 10.15.x)
   - Updated to OpenCore 0.6.4. I am no longer using this machine for regular usage from Dec-2020. But the EFI was tested on the machine.
   - Updated to BigSur without any issues. Seems to work fine.
   - Update 03/11/2020 Changed to iMac15,1 to run BigSur Stable Update as mentioned in [Dortania Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/ivy-bridge.html#platforminfo "Dortania Guide")
   - Improved stablity by using SSDT-HPET.<br/>
- ***4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM***<br/>
- ***ASRock H61M-S1 Plus MotherBoard***<br/>
- ***MSI Nvidia GeForce GT 710 with 2GB Video Memory which is a GK208 chip variant*** (https://amzn.to/3l1ANTn)<br/>
- ***Seagate Desktop HDD 1TB Storage***<br/>
